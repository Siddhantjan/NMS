## Problem Statement :
Various Kinds of devices are available in the market, which are broadly classified in three different ways :- 
- Network Devices

- Windows Based Devices

We need to Develop a network monitoring system which can do performance analysis of all the types of devices listed above using plugin-based architecture with the help of various protocols like SNMP,SSH,and WinRM.
